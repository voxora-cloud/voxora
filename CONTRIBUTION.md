# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Voxora! Please read these guidelines before opening an issue or pull request.

## Getting started

- Follow the Quick start guide in README to set up Docker services and run the apps.
- Use Node.js >= 18 and npm 10+.
- Copy `.env.development` to `.env` in `apps/api` and `apps/web` (adjust as needed).

## Project structure

- `apps/web`: Next.js 15 React 19 app (UI, pages, components)
- `apps/api`: Express + Socket.IO backend (routes, sockets, models)
- `packages/*`: shared configs (ESLint, TS)
- `docker/`: local dev services

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused and small. One PR per logical change.
3. Write clear commit messages (Conventional Commits encouraged):
   - feat: add X
   - fix: correct Y
   - docs: update Z
4. Ensure code builds, lints, and types check:

```bash
npm i
```

5. Verify the apps run locally:

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

6. Add/update minimal tests where appropriate (if/when test harness exists).

## Style and quality

- Run `npm run format` before pushing.
- Follow existing patterns, naming, and folder structure.
- Validate API changes with helpful error handling and input validation.
- Avoid committing `.env` files, build artifacts, or large assets.

## Security & secrets

- Never commit secrets. Use environment variables.
- Disclose security issues privately (do not open public issues).
